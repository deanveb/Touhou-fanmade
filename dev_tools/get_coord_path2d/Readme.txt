For the circle formula always use (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = R^2, x^2 + y^2 = R^2 will throw an error
convert.py (can't be seen in Godot's FileSytem for some reason):
	+ Copy the equations into input.txt
	+ Run "Run.bat"
	+ Then in Godot run create_bullet_path2d.tscn
	+ A Path2D will be created in result_pattern folder
	+ We only need Path2D's curve so save it's curve into your stage folder
